## IMPORTANT!
This program is not officially supported for any other operating systems aside from Windows AMD64; hopefully with enough wait(, I will do it or someone else will initiate a pull-request,) it will be done.
The program is also highly beta-y, more progress is planned to happen.

## Why?
The purpose of this app is to provide users with a convenient solution for generating an easy-to-read file that maps out the locations of folders and their corresponding purposes. With the ever-increasing complexity of file systems, it can be challenging to keep track of the various folders and their intended uses. By utilizing this app, users can effortlessly generate a human-readable file that serves as a visual representation of the folder hierarchy and their assigned purposes. This mapping file can be easily updated and edited by the user, ensuring that it remains up-to-date and reflective of the current state of their file system. This app aims to simplify folder organization, enhance productivity, and facilitate better collaboration among users.

## Features.
1. **Generation of maps:** Maps can be generated by using the create command after using it in the right path. These files will take on the parent folder's name + an added '.HDM' (which may or may not be visable. The file is in a standard text format, though each layer from the imidiate children adds indentation and each folder name is incased in square brackets.

## How to obtain the executable.

The more simpler method for any supported platform, these can be found in the 'executables' folder in the main project.
### To compile the program:
1. Go to the 'src' folder.
